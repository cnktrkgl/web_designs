                <h1>Grand Theft Auto Vice City</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the 1980s. From the decade of big hair, excess, and pastel suits comes a story of one
                    man's rise to the top of the criminal pile as Grand Theft Auto returns.</p>
                <p>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective.
                    The player controls criminal Tommy Vercetti and completes missions—linear scenarios with set
                    objectives—to progress through the story.
                    It is possible to have several missions available at a time, as some missions require the player to
                    wait for further instructions or events.
                    Outside of missions, the player can freely roam the game's open world and has the ability to
                    complete optional side missions.
                    Composed of two main islands and several smaller areas, the world is much larger in area than
                    earlier entries in the series.
                    The islands are unlocked for the player as the story progresses.
                </p>
                <p>The player may run, jump, or drive vehicles to navigate the game's world. The player uses melee
                    attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies.
                    The firearms include weapons such as the Colt Python, an M60 machine gun and a Minigun.
                    The game's three-dimension environment allows a first-person view while aiming with the sniper rifle
                    and rocket launcher.
                    In addition, the game's combat allows the player to commit drive-by shootings by facing sideways in
                    a vehicle.
                    The game provides the player a wide variety of weapon options—they can be purchased from local
                    firearms dealers, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.
                    In combat, auto-aim can be used as assistance against enemies.
                    Should the player take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated through the use of health
                    pick-ups.
                    Body armour can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process.
                    When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops and the player respawns at the nearest hospital
                    while losing all weapons and armour and some of their money.
                    If the player commits crimes while playing, the game's law enforcement agencies may respond as
                    indicated by a "wanted" meter in the head-up display (HUD), which increases as the player commits
                    more crimes.
                    On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level, and the higher the level, the
                    greater the response for law enforcement (for example, at the maximum six-star level, police
                    helicopters and military swarm to lethally dispatch players).
                    During the story, Tommy meets characters from various gangs.
                    As the player completes missions for different gangs, fellow gang members will often defend the
                    player, while rival gang members will recognise the player and subsequently shoot on sight.
                    While free roaming the game world, the player may engage in activities such as a vigilante minigame,
                    a fire fighting activity, a paramedic service and a taxi cab service.
                    Completion of these activities grants the player with context-specific rewards.
                    As Tommy builds his criminal empire, the player may purchase a number of properties distributed
                    across the city, some of which act as additional hideouts where weapons can be collected and
                    vehicles can be stored.
                    There are also a variety of businesses which can be purchased, including a pornographic film studio,
                    a taxi company, and several entertainment clubs.
                    Each commercial property has a number of missions attached to it, such as eliminating competition or
                    stealing equipment; once all missions are complete, the property begins to generate an ongoing
                    income available for the player.
